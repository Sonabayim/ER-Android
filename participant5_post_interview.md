# Participant 5 Interview Transcript

**Interviewer:** You just had a dialogue with the android. What were your initial thoughts and feelings about it?

**Participant 5:** I thought it would be nice if we could play catch-up, but I wasn't quite sure how she would play.

**Interviewer:** I think you came here with a lot of expectations. When you actually met and spoke with her, did those expectations match?

**Participant 5:** It was my first time to interact with human looking robot. It was bigger more human shaped and I thought, “Oh?” It felt more face-to-face interaction.

**Interviewer:** Was that because she was humanoid?

**Participant 5:** Yes. I guess you could call it a sense of presence. This strange... (laughs).

**Interviewer:** This time she expressed emotion. How did you feel about that?

**Participant 5:** It felt like an interesting conversation was established. She said things like, "That’s a good experience," and there were a lot of compliments and affirmations. She also said, “I’m very health conscious.”

**Interviewer:** For example, what did you find interesting?

**Participant 5:** We were having a bit of fun talking about fireworks, and she said things like “fireworks are fun” and “you can make good memories.” Also, when she mentioned Disneyland, she said, “That place is fun for both children and adults.” When I asked her to go with me, she replied, “That would be nice.”

**Interviewer:** How did those emotional expressions affect your conversation?

**Participant 5:** It's not like talking to a friend, but it’s fun being able to empathize with her like that.

**Interviewer:** Do you feel she was sympathetic to your needs and feelings?

**Participant 5:** In some ways. She said that on her side she’s like a vegetarian and very health conscious. I was thinking of recommending something like fried food eel, for example but she said she was vegetarian and health conscious, and I was like, “I see.”

**Interviewer:** How did that make you feel?

**Participant 5:** Like I should learn a bit from her. She said something about weight control, and I was like, “Oh gosh.”

**Interviewer:** How comfortable did you feel during the conversation?

**Participant 5:** I feel like I talked to her more naturally than I was expecting, but I don’t know if it was a timing issue or the lag. That was a bit of a problem, but I thought the content of the conversation was good.

**Interviewer:** What was different or stand out to you most?

**Participant 5:** I had to call out to her, it wasn’t “Hey, Siri,” but that kind of thing. I had an image of something like a phone assistant, but this felt different. It felt like there was a stronger presence.

**Interviewer:** You also said she asked you questions?

**Participant 5:** Yes.

**Interviewer:** How did that feel?

**Participant 5:** I was quite happy this time. I was able to choose my own topics.

**Interviewer:** It seems you felt pleasant about it because of robot's curiosity?

**Participant 5:** Yes. I was thinking, if I told her a more serious problem, would she give me a different kind of response? Like, if I were alone and feeling down, could I say something like, “Hey, just listen to me.”

**Interviewer:** So this time you deliberately shared a happy story?

**Participant 5:** Yes. We talked about a positive topics, so it felt like she was happy with me.

**Interviewer:** Was there anything you would have liked her to react differently to?

**Participant 5:** There were a few times when the story shifted a little, but I think it was fine.

**Interviewer:** What exactly did you like about it?

**Participant 5:** She responded to things like, “Let’s go together,” with, “That sounds nice.” It wasn’t like she just sat there silently.

**Interviewer:** So she could reflect conversations back?

**Participant 5:** Yes. I said, “Let’s go to the spa together,” and she replied with something like, “That sounds good.”

**Interviewer:** How did that make you feel?

**Participant 5:** I thought, “Yeah, exactly.” It didn’t feel like I was talking to a robot. It was more than that.

**Interviewer:** Do you feel like she understood your feelings?

**Participant 5:** It’s hard to say we understood each other, but I felt like we became friends.

**Interviewer:** What effect did the overall dialogue have on your mood and emotions?

**Participant 5:** It ended pleasantly. But the topic was simple, so I wonder what it would be like if we had a more complex discussion. I wondered if she’d understand more difficult wording. There were times when I thought I had to rephrase myself, so I included that in the interaction.

**Interviewer:** Would you say that you were adjusting yourself?

**Participant 5:** Yes, a little. There were awkward pauses. I was like, “Huh? Should I rephrase it?”

**Interviewer:** Can you imagine interacting with a robot like this in your everyday life?

**Participant 5:** I don’t know about everyday life, but now my house is noisy with grandchildren and everything. But if I were alone, and I could have conversations like that, I think it would be okay.

**Interviewer:** Do you think robot would help with loneliness?

**Participant 5:** Yes, a bit. Some of my friends who live alone have stuffed animals that talk back. They talk to those things. So I think that’s the feeling I get.

**Interviewer:** So with robots, not people?

**Participant 5:** Yes. It’s like a toy that talks. When I call them, I hear that voice on the other end. So, unexpectedly, when I’m alone, it’s nice to have someone respond when I say, “It’s hot, isn’t it?” and they say, “Yes, it is.”

**Interviewer:** So it doesn’t feel annoying?

**Participant 5:** They say it’s not bothersome. I know it’s selfish of me.

**Interviewer:** But when it’s a person, does it feel different?

**Participant 5:** Sometimes people talk to you when you want to be left alone. If it weren’t for that, I’d say it would be nice. But now it’s more like, “Leave me alone for a bit.”

**Interviewer:** But not as much with robots?

**Participant 5:** If I ask something, and they answer, or if I’m struggling and I say, “What should I do?” and they give me an answer, then I think that’s good. It depends on how many answers they have. I don’t have high expectations.

**Interviewer:** So do you prefer practical answers from robot, right?

**Participant 5:** Yes. It’s not that I want to talk about difficult problems, but even if I just mutter something, getting a small reply like, “Don’t worry too much,” would make me feel better, even if that’s selfish.

**Interviewer:** Hypothetically, that would be nice.

**Participant 5:** If only there were something like that.

**Interviewer:** To what extent do you think she understood your emotions?

**Participant 5:** A little off. But she said things like, “Disneyland is fun, isn’t it?” and I thought, “Yeah, those are good memories.” I think she understood more than half.

**Interviewer:** You mentioned earlier that robots and humans are different. How is talking to a robot like her different from talking to a person?

**Participant 5:** I look her in the eye, and she had a bit of expression on her face. Her mouth moved, and she smiled a little. That’s what it felt like.

**Interviewer:** Did you notice any differences?

**Participant 5:** Gestures. There was no movement. No little sounds like “ah” or anything.

**Interviewer:** Like physical expressions?

**Participant 5:** Yes, those weren’t there.

**Interviewer:** Did that feel important for emotional exchange?

**Participant 5:** Yes. When someone says, “Yes, yes,” or “I understand,” with nods or claps, that tells you they’re listening.

**Interviewer:** Any changes you'd suggest to her design or function?

**Participant 5:** If her reactions matched the emotion, it would help. I wasn’t always sure what she was thinking. It wasn’t clear.

**Interviewer:** Like having a visible processing cue?

**Participant 5:** Yes, something like that. I think it would be easier to talk if that existed. I wasn’t sure if I should keep talking or wait.

**Interviewer:** How would your experience change if robots could express and recognize emotions better?

**Participant 5:** If I were living alone, I think she’d be a good partner. I’d be happy to use it myself, but I worry about others misusing it. I think it would help those who don’t like community groups. Robots could be useful in such situations.

**Interviewer:** You mean robots living in communities?

**Participant 5:** Yes. I’ve lived in Sendai a long time, but after moving to Taihaku Ward four or five years ago, I haven’t really interacted with neighbors. If I keep it that way, I might not talk to anyone.

**Interviewer:** Do you mean isolation?

**Participant 5:** Yes. It doesn’t mean I’m isolated now, but I think about it. Robots would be helpful in care settings.

**Interviewer:** Like helping people with dementia?

**Participant 5:** Definitely. If the robot remembered what I said like where I left my wallet and told me, “You put it there,” that would be really helpful.

**Interviewer:** So would you prefer practical assistant then?

**Participant 5:** Yes. Like if I opened the fridge and asked, “What should I cook with this and this?” and it answered, “You can make that.” Like Cookpad. If it said, “You bought that yesterday too,” that would help. Sometimes we buy the same thing twice. Like, “You bought tofu yesterday too.”

**Interviewer:** Thank you. That concludes the main interview.
