## Interaction Issues

- **Assumption of user identity** without confirmation.
    
- **Failure to respond meaningfully** to reflective or philosophical prompts.
    
- **Literal interpretation of metaphorical language.**
    
- **Repetitive and shallow affirmations** instead of emotional engagement.
    
- **Inconsistent or excessive use of gestures**, especially "smile" in inappropriate contexts.
    
- **Referring to self in third person**, breaking immersion and relational continuity.

## Positive Engagement Moments

- **Participant openness**: High degree of emotional self-disclosure, valuable for understanding affective dynamics.
    
- **Emotion annotation**: Presence of emotion tags in each turn facilitates affective trajectory analysis.
    
- **Topic richness**: Interaction moves from personal anecdotes to philosophical reflections—ideal for emotional context testing.

## Translation Issues

- **Flattened metaphors**: e.g., “味を教えましょう” (“Let me tell you the flavour...”) was interpreted as literal food, missing poetic or symbolic meaning.
    
- **Simplified or awkward English**: Some responses sound robotic or template-based when translated.
    
- **Loss of nuance**: Japanese reflective or layered expressions were translated into overly direct English, removing emotional depth.
    
- **Emotion mismatch**: Emotional tone in Japanese sometimes not preserved or misaligned in English version.

## Limitations of Robot Responsiveness

- **Lack of adaptive empathy**: Bot often fails to deepen or personalize emotional content.
    
- **Over-reliance on template language**: Generic affirmations dominate; few tailored responses.
    
- **Gesture-emotion mismatch**: Excessive use of “smile” regardless of context.
    
- **Identity confusion**: Bot breaks narrative immersion by referring to itself in third person.
