## Translation & Interaction Notes

- **Turn 4 (Incorrect Functionality)**: Robot states the current time as _7:30 p.m._, while the correct time was _9:30 p.m._ User corrects it in Turn 5. Robot adjusts, but the initial error may have weakened trust.
    
- **Turns 6–7 (Emotional Shift)**: User mentions “working hard” as a value. Robot responds supportively, but fails to explore **why** this matters to the participant.
    
- **Turn 10 (Negative Disclosure)**: User shares disappointment over not being able to join a club. Robot responds with brief sympathy but does not probe for emotional elaboration or support.
    
- **Turns 13–14 (System Crash)**: Interaction around the ginkgo tree moment was emotionally resonant but cut short. The robot missed an opportunity to reflect deeply on this scene. Session continued but lost momentum.
    
- **Turns 14–20 (Increased Ambiguity)**: User explores introspective topics (doubt, selfhood, home), but robot relies heavily on repeating user language with minimal clarification, leading to a **disconnect**.
    
- **Turn 27 (Unrecognized Term)**: “Kanae-no-onna” not understood by the robot. A polite fallback was used, which is acceptable, though a prompt for elaboration would’ve encouraged further dialogue.
    
- **Turn 31 (Mistranslation)**: “Tsumego” (a Go puzzle) was mistaken for a regional snack. Robot responds with a fictional recipe.

## Interaction Observations

- **Dynamic Emotional Range**  
    Participant displayed a full spectrum: from joy in grandchildren’s stories to disappointment over club access and curiosity about emotional doubt. Robot was strongest in joyful moments, but under performed in introspective or abstract exchanges.
    
- **Topic Transitions**  
    Smooth at first, but became **chaotic and fragmented** after Turn 14. The robot struggled to anchor transitions, especially during emotionally abstract statements.
    
- **Prompting Style**  
    The robot relied heavily on rephrased clarifying questions and “Why do you think that is?” templates. While safe, it came across as repetitive rather than relational.
    
- **Recovery Attempts**  
    After each misunderstanding or system glitch, the robot attempted to return to topic. However, the effect was **mechanical** rather than conversational.

## Positive Engagement Moments

- **Chemistry & School (Turns 2–4)**: Nostalgic recall of academic life, rooted in personal history. Provided grounding for the participant to share confidently.
    
- **Joy in Hard Work & Hobbies (Turns 7–10)**: Participant described working hard, reading, and exercise with genuine affection. Robot acknowledged this positively.
    
- **Travel & Nature Reflection (Turns 11–13)**: The memory of golden ginkgo leaves in Yamagata Prefecture was described with poetic imagery. This was the interaction's **emotional peak**.
    
- **Grandchildren’s Stories (Turns 22–24)**: Participant found joy in children’s imagination and spontaneity. This section shows warmth and a playful appreciation for the unexpected.
    
- **Zunda-Mochi Exchange (Turns 28–30)**: A culturally grounded and emotionally light segment. Clear, fun, and affirming.
