## Summary

Participant was highly engaged and talkative, centering most of the dialogue on mahjong, daily routines, and memories of her late mother. The conversation blended technical strategy (defense, scoring) with grief processing. Emotional tone shifted gently from curiosity and happiness to episodes of sadness and back, aided by the robot’s mostly empathetic stance.

## Translation Issues

- **Turn 11**: JP “振り込み” explained literally in EN as “discarding into other players’ wins,” which is correct but might be clarified as _dealing-in_ for English-speaking mahjong players.
    
- **Turn 18**: The robot’s EN explanation of “筋” as “suji theory” is accurate yet opaque for novices; a brief parenthetical (“safe-tile lines”) would improve clarity.
    
- **Turn 19**: Formula “fu × 2^(han+2)” given verbally; could confuse readers unfamiliar with caret notation. Superscript or explicit “2 to the power of” would avoid misreading.

## Interaction Issues

- **Turn 8 (User sad)**: Robot responded with “happy” emotion and “smile” gesture (“It must be especially beautiful…”)—risk of _over-cheerfulness_ while user expressed loneliness.
    
- **Turn 5**: Robot chose “curious” shortly after a sad disclosure.
        
- **Gesture Repetition**: 19/32 robot turns marked “smile,” producing gesture monotony.
