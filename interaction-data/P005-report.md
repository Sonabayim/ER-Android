## Translation Issues

- **Turn 24**: “丁寧に人が集まるのは大丈夫ですか” translated as “Is it okay if lots of people gather politely?”
    
    - **Issue**: Literal but awkward. Likely meant to ask if large gatherings are safe.
        
    - **Fix**: Translate pragmatically, e.g., “Is it safe for many people to gather?”
        
- **Turn 20**: “今度一緒に行きたいですね” rendered as “I’d like to go together next time.”
    
    - **Issue**: Slightly vague; lacks emotional nuance. Could benefit from “It’d be nice to go together sometime.”
