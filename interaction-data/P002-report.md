##  Translation Issues

- **Turn 5**: Misunderstanding due to homophones. “習活” (lesson activity) misinterpreted as “就活” (job hunting).
- **Turn 35**: Emotional nuance lost. User expressed insecurity about her own gardening skills, but the robot response flattened this self-reflection.

---

## Interaction Issues

- **Turn 17**: Robot failed to acknowledge grief expression about brother’s death.
  - **Fix**: Add emotional keyword detection for words like “亡くなった” or “辛かった”.
- **Turn 31**: User asked robot’s age, causing mild derailment.
  - **Fix**: Prepare casual/friendly responses for meta-questions.
