# Participant 2 Interview Transcript

**Interviewer:** You spoke with the android this time. What were your initial thoughts and feelings about speaking with it?

**Participant 2:** When I first saw her, she looked like a very beautiful young woman much prettier than us older folks. But at my age, it's often difficult to make myself clearly heard and understood. Perhaps a younger person's voice would have been easier for the android to understand. I thought I was speaking clearly, but the machine didn't seem to understand me fully. Maybe it’s challenging due to the inherent difference between a human and a machine.

**Interviewer:** How did you feel when you realized you were not being understood?

**Participant 2:** When I thought about what to say next, my mind went blank. I wished I could express myself more clearly. As I'm getting older, it's becoming harder. The android is so young and beautiful, and I wished to communicate better. This android is meant for older people, isn't it? It seems like a nursing robot. My speech and memory are gradually weakening. Yesterday, my friend told me about a classmate who passed away, reminding me how old we are getting. It felt very real. My husband has been ill since March, possibly due to heavy smoking when he was younger it's worse than emphysema. He now uses oxygen. Since March, neither of us has had much personal time. My husband used to manage everything himself, so adjusting has been hard. Now I have to plan meals for both of us, which feels very different. I also need to plan my day around basic tasks like bathing, which makes days pass quickly, ending around 5 or 6 p.m. Is there anything else you'd like to ask?

**Interviewer:** Did your expectations of the android differ from your actual experience?

**Participant 2:** Android-san was beautiful, and initially, I thought about not wanting to touch her. People often react positively to beauty and youth, like appreciating cherry blossoms. I had similar reactions. I visited Singapore a few years ago, and the begonias in the garden there were stunning. I love begonias and grow a couple of types myself. Perhaps due to the warmer climate now in Japan, begonias grow even from fallen seeds. Climate change is worrying, although Sendai hasn't faced severe consequences, aside from earthquakes, like the time we had no water supply or bus services for a month, which was very tough. I wanted to discuss the recent heavy rains in Akita with the android, but perhaps my unclear speech made it difficult for her to understand.

My parents spoke with heavy accents, so understanding dialects isn't usually an issue for me, though my daughter was told she had an accent in school, which surprised me. Perhaps speaking louder or clearer would have helped the android understand better.

**Interviewer:** So you expected the android to understand you better than it actually did?

**Participant 2:** Yes. I assumed that being a smart AI robot, it would quickly grasp what I was saying, but perhaps my speech wasn't clear enough.

**Interviewer:** The android had emotional expressions. How did you feel about these?

**Participant 2:** She responded positively to pleasant topics like cherry blossoms and baths, but not to sad or unpleasant topics, like my brother's passing. Maybe she couldn't handle or didn't prefer such stories. She understood when I talked about my grandchildren, but the sad stories seemed beyond her scope.

**Interviewer:** Did you feel the android empathized with your emotions?

**Participant 2:** Yes, she did for cheerful topics, but she did not respond to sad ones. I wished for some comforting acknowledgment of my struggles, but perhaps empathy wasn't part of her programming.

**Interviewer:** How comfortable did you feel during your interaction?

**Participant 2:** Quite comfortable discussing pleasant things like flowers and the pool. The android asked detailed questions, making the conversation enjoyable. I initially struggled to reply about some things, but overall, it was pleasant to talk with her.

**Interviewer:** Is there anything you wished the android had reacted to differently?

**Participant 2:** Perhaps just showing empathy for sad stories. But overall, she quickly recognized and responded well to happy or pleasant topics.

**Interviewer:** Could you imagine regularly interacting with a robot like this in daily life?

**Participant 2:** I could, although affordability might be an issue for pensioners. It could greatly benefit those who live alone, offering company without intruding into personal spaces. A robot could cheer up care home residents by singing or playing games. Such interactions could significantly uplift the elderly.

**Interviewer:** Would you personally welcome such an interaction?

**Participant 2:** Yes, if costs and logistics allowed. I believe it would greatly enrich the lives of elderly individuals, especially those who otherwise experience isolation.

**Interviewer:** Do you find communicating emotions different with an android compared to humans?

**Participant 2:** Not significantly. The android’s recognition was generally accurate, although she occasionally misunderstood. She could identify specific cultural references like "tabi" socks, which surprised me. Emotionally, there might be some gaps compared to human interaction, particularly in addressing sadness or loss.

**Interviewer:** Would you suggest any improvements to the android’s design or functions?

**Participant 2:** Her appearance was very appealing, youthful and beautiful. No significant changes needed there. Functionally, improving emotional expression and deeper understanding could make interactions even more rewarding.

**Interviewer:** How might your experience change if the android had richer emotional expressions?

**Participant 2:** I would feel more drawn to her, feeling more like I was talking to another human. Richer emotional capabilities would likely enhance our interactions significantly.

**Interviewer:** Thank you very much for your detailed feedback.

**Participant 2:** You're welcome. I enjoyed participating and would be glad to help again.
