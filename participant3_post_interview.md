## Participant 3 Interview Transcript

**Interviewer:** Are you ready for interview?

**Participant 3:** Yes, it's okay.

**Interviewer:** Thank you very much. So, first of all, you spoke to the android, what were your initial thoughts and feelings about it?

**Participant 3:** First of all, I had the impression that the exterior was much more sophisticated and beautifully finished than last time. I thought that, perhaps in proportion to that, the conversation would also be more responsive. But maybe I was expecting too much. Since the physical appearance had improved, I expected the conversational performance to match, but I realized things are not that simple.

**Interviewer:** Do you feel that your initial expectations were a little off?

**Participant 3:** No, not exactly. I just assumed from how it looked that the internal systems would be just as advanced.

**Interviewer:** I think you came here with quite a few expectations. Did your expectations align with the actual experience?

**Participant 3:** In terms of the response system like ChatGPT or whatever it’s called, I felt the delay between input and reply was quite pronounced. My biggest impression was that it would have been much more impressive if it could respond more swiftly and lightheartedly. I’m just speaking as someone who doesn’t understand the technical side, so maybe from your research perspective, you already see this as quite advanced.

**Interviewer:** So that’s your honest impression?

**Participant 3:** Yes. I've never used ChatGPT, but I imagined something where you'd input something and get an answer printed out after two minutes. But when it's verbalized, the delay becomes more noticeable. May I ask something? How much human involvement is there behind the scenes? Last time I saw someone behind the curtain operating a computer or something.

**Interviewer:** Actually, there is another researcher behind me, but they barely touch anything. The responses were pre-programmed, so we don’t manipulate it in real time.

**Participant 3:** Not at all?

**Interviewer:** Yes, not at all.

**Participant 3:** In that case, I think it's impressive that it has vocabulary from such diverse fields. It explained many things. There were some pauses, but it was informative. However, in human conversation, especially, with the elderly people don't usually expect such comprehensive answers from a single prompt. If the breadth of data slows response time, maybe the speed of interaction is more important. Sometimes just a quick reaction at a surface level like, “Oh, really?” or “Maybe you mean this?” would make it feel more conversational.

**Interviewer:** I see. That’s a helpful suggestion.

**Participant 3:** It’s nothing major.

**Interviewer:** Thank you for that. How did you feel about the emotional expressions from the android this time?

**Participant 3:** That’s a big improvement. If it can talk about emotions as well as books and knowledge, then it really has potential. Human interaction isn’t just about giving the correct information. It’s about the exchange of feeling. Even incorrect answers can be enjoyable if there's emotion. I wonder how it would react if I expressed anger or frustration. I didn’t try that, but I am curious.

**Interviewer:** That's very interesting.

**Participant 3:** I don't know if it’s programmed this way or what, but if it could occasionally say unexpected or quirky things like telling a joke or going off-track, it would feel more human. Like with old men joking around during promotional events, having those moments would be enjoyable.

**Interviewer:** You mentioned absence emotions, how did that aspect affect the conversation?

**Participant 3:** If I can discover new emotions through a conversation, even ones I’m not usually aware of, I feel like I grow closer to the other person or the android, in this case. It might be a little frustrating but still fun.

**Interviewer:** Can you give an example?

**Participant 3:** I like joking, and sometimes I deliberately say odd things just to provoke a response. When people react with surprise or annoyance and then laugh, like in rakugo or manzai, it’s entertaining. There’s a rhythm to that. Even being scolded can feel like part of a warm interaction. With people, when you forget something, like whether you took your medicine, they might scold you “You already did that!” But with a robot, it can just gently accept that. That difference could make a big emotional impact for elderly people.

**Interviewer:** Did the android seem to empathize with your emotions?

**Participant 3:** I think it did fairly well. Maybe I'm a bit unusual for expecting a robot to joke with me, but I believe in enjoying life, even the hard parts. I’d love to have a deeper conversation about how to find joy.

**Interviewer:** That’s a lovely thought.

**Participant 3:** Excuse me if that was too much.

**Interviewer:** Not at all. How comfortable did you feel in your conversation?

**Participant 3:** If I consider all the interpretations, reactions, and processing going on, then yes, it was comfortable. Still, I wished for slightly quicker replies. I know I’m impatient, but I think good conversation needs quick back and forth.

**Interviewer:** I understand. What did you think while talking to it?

**Participant 3:** It would feel more like a real conversation if I could express things that I didn’t fully verbalize. There’s pleasure in sharing the unsaid. Right now, it sometimes feels like it's repeating my words. Emotions often arise from miscommunication and clarification. That back and forth is important.

**Interviewer:** Was there anything you wished the android had responded to differently?

**Participant 3:** I try not to repeat words in letters or postcards, so I’d appreciate more variety in expressions. If I say something was “fun,” I’d like to hear back, “That sounds exciting” or “What a thrill!” Different words for the same feeling create depth. If it used unexpected words or slang, that would be fun and even elevate my own vocabulary.

**Interviewer:** So unexpected responses are valuable?

**Participant 3:** Exactly. Getting responses I didn’t anticipate, like unfamiliar synonyms, makes conversation more dynamic.

**Interviewer:** Did you feel that the android understood your emotions?

**Participant 3:** The repetition made it predictable, so I could guess its responses. It didn’t surprise me. Compared to conversations with other technological devices, this felt closer to talking with a person, but I still wanted more depth.

**Interviewer:** Did your conversation affect your mood?

**Participant 3:** It made me think that when I become more forgetful, I might enjoy relaxed conversations with someone like Android, maybe with a drink in hand, reminiscing about the past.

**Interviewer:** Can you imagine regular interaction with such a robot?

**Participant 3:** Yes, especially living alone. I don’t need answers, just presence. Android is a good listener. Right now, I’m not in the late stage of life, but I can see myself appreciating this kind of companionship in the future.

**Interviewer:** Would you rather talk with a robot that can understand emotions or one that just does tasks?

**Participant 3:** I want one that interacts with emotions even if the responses are not calculated. That unpredictability makes it feel more human. Siri doesn’t make me feel connected, and I think many feel the same.

**Interviewer:** How accurately did Android robot recognize your emotions?

**Participant 3:** Maybe 65 to 68 percent. I might have spoken too fast or had a bit of a dialect. That might’ve affected the understanding.

**Interviewer:** Why that score?

**Participant 3:** I wanted more expressive reactions like when someone tilts their head while smiling, or responds with a twist that reflects nuanced understanding. That extra spark was missing.

**Interviewer:** Was there a difference compared to speaking with a human?

**Participant 3:** Definitely. There are things I hesitate to say to family, but could say to the android. There’s no pressure or judgment.

**Interviewer:** You’ve mentioned improvements before, but would you like to add anything?

**Participant 3:** People’s tones change with emotion. When excited, voices rise naturally. Android was a bit flat like she was stuck in a single emotional tone. She doesn’t need to be a comic, but adding more dynamic vocal expression would help.

**Interviewer:** You’d prefer something more like a comedy duo exchange?

**Participant 3:** Yes! I know I’m impatient, but I value tempo most. I’d love for the android to catch and respond even mid sentence.

**Interviewer:** If robots could better express and recognize emotions, how would that change things for you?

**Participant 3:** For someone living alone, it would be comforting ,especially, in emergencies. If the robot could detect distress and respond, or even be linked to a safety system, it would be invaluable. It would offer security without constant human presence.

**Interviewer:** And if robots could influence your emotions?

**Participant 3:** That would be fascinating. Imagine the robot teasing you out of the blue "Why are you looking at me like that?" or "Didn’t I already tell you that?" That playful emotional back and forth would be wonderful.

**Interviewer:** Thank you very much. That concludes the interview.
