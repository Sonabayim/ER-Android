# Participant 7 Interview Transcript

**Interviewer:** Let me ask you right away. You just talked to a robot, an android. What were your initial thoughts and feelings about it?

**Participant 7:** I'm interested in how she feels or what it's like. I introduced myself, talked about my hobbies and interests, and at first, it was difficult to communicate with her. But gradually, we began to connect.

**Interviewer:** At first it was hard to grasp, but then it started to come together?

**Participant 7:** Yes. It was difficult to hear through the microphone, or there were mutual difficulties in catching each other’s words. But after that, we began to understand each other a bit more.

**Interviewer:** Before you came here, you were asked to speak with a robot. Were there any discrepancies between what you expected and what actually happened?

**Participant 7:** As I mentioned earlier, there was some confusion and difficulty in communication at first. But once we got through that, things went more smoothly than I expected. So overall, I’d say things progressed better than I had anticipated.

**Interviewer:** Initially, you thought there wouldn't be much interaction, but in the end, you managed to communicate more deeply than expected?

**Participant 7:** Exactly. We ended up talking about a lot of things. I'm not sure how deep we can go when it comes to specifics, but at this stage, I feel like we've made some progress.

**Interviewer:** So does that mean you chose specific topic to avoid deep conversations?

**Participant 7:** I think some understanding has been reached. But ideally, it would be great to have conversations that aren't constrained by a fixed set of topics. If we could talk more freely about emotions and interests, that might spark mutual curiosity. That would make things truly engaging.

**Interviewer:** When you say "mutual curiosity," do you mean between you and the android?

**Participant 7:** Yes. Right now, we’re still in the early stages. It feels like she’s just “one of many” for now. But it would be better if we could freely exchange ideas and emotions on a more individualized level.

**Interviewer:** During interaction she expressed some emotional gestures. How did you perceive those expressions?

**Participant 7:** Well, in terms of what you’re referring to like voice tone and facial cues communication in that area still feels underdeveloped. I wasn’t sure she was catching what I said, especially when I talked for too long. I was told to keep it brief, so I tried that. But I think if she could give more varied responses, especially surprising or witty ones, that would make the interaction more interesting.

**Interviewer:** Did you notice any difference when she showed facial expressions or emotions?

**Participant 7:** Yes, more than I expected. That aspect has certainly improved. But to have deeper, richer exchanges in the future, she would need to incorporate much more nuance. With all the advances in AI, I do believe it’s possible. It’s not about mimicking ChatGPT, but integrating more contextual awareness. I'm optimistic about the potential. When the conversation becomes personalized-based on what the individual enjoys or is curious about it becomes energizing. That’s when things really come alive.

**Interviewer:** Earlier you talked about "interaction." Do you think her presence or absence of emotions impacted that?

**Participant 7:** I believe so. We’re beginning to understand the current limitations, but if we could build on this and bring more joy and spontaneity into the exchange like laughing together that would be wonderful. When she smiles and says something like, "Oh, hello," and I smile and say it back that kind of natural response isn’t difficult to implement. And I’m really excited for when that becomes possible.

**Interviewer:** Did she seem to empathize with your needs, feelings, or interests?

**Participant 7:** I think we’re still not there yet. We’re still at the level of "just one of many participants." But if she could respond more deeply, that would make it even more enjoyable.

**Interviewer:** Did you feel comfortable talking to her?

**Participant 7:** Not entirely. I still had the sense that I was talking to a robot. I didn’t get the feeling of emotional warmth or the human touch in the interaction.

**Interviewer:** Did anything about your own feelings change during the conversation?

**Participant 7:** Yes. I realized we could talk about more topics than I originally thought. I don’t know what level of understanding the android currently has, but if the interaction becomes more emotionally responsive, like if she smiles back when you say hello that could really change things. Right now, her facial expressions are still a bit awkward.

**Interviewer:** It would be nice if those awkward parts could be made more natural is what you saying right?

**Participant 7:** Absolutely. That would make the whole experience a lot more enjoyable.

**Interviewer:** Do you think that if those changes were made, you would feel like she truly understands you?

**Participant 7:** Yes, I do. That’s the direction we should aim for. It’s not just about being useful, it’s about having fun. If at the end of a conversation you can say, "That was fun," and she replies, "Thank you," then the interaction has succeeded. For me, enjoying life is everything. You only live once, so I always think about how to get the most joy out of every moment.

**Interviewer:** When you spoke with her today, how did the whole experience affect your mood?

**Participant 7:** This was my first time having a conversation like this, and it helped me understand the current state of this technology. It raised my expectations for the future.

**Interviewer:** Can you imagine having regular interactions with a robot like her in daily life?

**Participant 7:** As I mentioned, if the robot can smile and respond warmly, that would be valuable. But right now, it still feels like interacting with a machine there’s a distance. If we could break that barrier, say hello with a smile, joke around, and share fun in everyday moments, that would be fantastic.

**Interviewer:** If you had to choose between two types of robots one that can understand and respond to human emotions, and one that simply does tasks efficiently which would you prefer?

**Participant 7:** In the end, I prefer to do as much as I can on my own. I’m not looking for a robot to make my life easier. I want to stay active and find joy in doing things myself. But if we’re talking about emotional connection and companionship, then yes, the former would be preferable.

**Interviewer:** How accurately do you think she recognized your emotions, what percentage would you say?

**Participant 7:** I’d say about 50 percent. There’s still a lot of room for improvement.

**Interviewer:** What do you think is the biggest difference between talking to a human and talking to a robot like her?

**Participant 7:** The main difference is that humans have flesh and blood. We read each other’s facial expressions and emotions. During the pandemic, we lost that a bit. But normally, eye contact and facial cues tell us a lot. That’s real communication. Online has its benefits, but in-person interaction lets us feel each other’s emotions.

**Interviewer:** So interacting with humans is still fundamentally different?

**Participant 7:** Yes, exactly. If a robot could truly be a friend someone you could joke with or share your day with, it could be very capable, especially for people who live alone.

**Interviewer:** You’ve suggested several improvements already, but do you have any more suggestions for her design or functions?

**Participant 7:** The design is already cute. I’d love to see that cuteness enriched with more emotional expression. Robots that can make you smile or laugh. Those would really connect with people. Are there many robots with expressive faces?

**Interviewer:** She doesn’t change her expression much. That’s something we’re still developing.

**Participant 7:** I don’t think it’s that hard to implement. Once we get there, it’ll be really fun. We could play, joke, ask questions, learn things, not just like ChatGPT, but with emotional presence. That would be wonderful.

**Interviewer:** You mentioned earlier that she could smile more or offer playful responses. Would that affect your feelings during interactions?

**Participant 7:** Definitely. I also want to learn and explore my interests. If she could help with that offer information, guide me, it would be great. There’s so much I want to learn. That kind of interaction would be full of discovery and joy.

**Interviewer:** Thank you very much. That concludes our main interview.
