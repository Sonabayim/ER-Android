**Participant 6 Interview Transcript**

**Interviewer:** You had a dialogue with an android earlier. What were your initial thoughts and feelings about that?

**Participant 6:** I spoke to her thinking it would be like talking to a human, but again, with robots even though there are a lot of them in the world the Japanese language is especially tricky. I said "thanks," but it didn't register as "thanks." So when creating robots that understand a specific country's language, there's the issue of the same word having different meanings. I thought it would be impossible for robots to distinguish those nuances. Even saying something like "yama" or "san" for mountain can be tricky. It might be okay in daily conversation, but the ambiguity would be difficult for robots in the AI field.

**Interviewer:** You mean in terms of word recognition?

**Participant 6:** Yes, especially in Japanese.

**Interviewer:** I think you were asked to talk to the robot before coming here. I wonder if you had various expectations.

**Participant 6:** A few months ago, there was a robot doll at the entrance of Fujisaki department store. When I first saw it, I thought, “Ugh.” It wasn’t a person, it was clearly a robot and it gave me a bad shock. But this time, I had already seen something similar, so I didn’t feel that way.

**Interviewer:** Were there matches or gaps between your expectations and the actual experience?

**Participant 6:** When we talked, I felt the robot was very much just a robot. There are many types of robots now like conversational robots but it’s still difficult to have a fluid conversation with them. I thought adapting to individual personalities would be a real challenge. Reading someone’s thoughts is still difficult for robots.

**Interviewer:** Earlier, you mentioned that she showed some emotions. How did you perceive those expressions?

**Participant 6:** The part where she laughed made me really happy. She laughed when I talked about cat toys. Maezawa's robot is used in commercials and is sold in electronics stores now. Everyone says the eye movements are cute. Compared to before, the eyes have become much more expressive. But honestly, I think cats and dogs are better at reading emotions than robots. You can ask a dog to sit and it'll obey. Robots, like Asimo, might turn off a light, but animals are cuter. Sorry, maybe I'm sounding weird or negative.

**Interviewer:** No, no, feel free to speak your mind. When you felt there was no emotion, how did you interpret that?

**Participant 6:** When there was no emotional expression, it was just a neutral face. Really normal, nothing stood out.

**Interviewer:** How about her facial expressions in general?

**Participant 6:** The only one I noticed was her smiling expression. Aside from that, her eyes seemed to show she was listening, but there were no other expressions.

**Interviewer:** How did those expressions affect your conversation?

**Participant 6:** I talked about cats, and she asked, “What kind of games do you play with them?” But I’ve never really played games with cats, so I was puzzled. I said I liked things that swing on a string, and she replied, “Yes, I like that too.” Then she started talking about using ribbons and string. But she kept elaborating on the idea of string, and I thought, “A string is a string.” I wasn’t sure how to explain it to her. The conversation went a bit off-track. My responses weren’t clear, and I think it was hard for her to follow me.

**Interviewer:** and you tried to explain yourself during conversation?

**Participant 6:** Yes, I kept wondering how I could explain things so that she would understand me.

**Interviewer:** Did you feel she was sympathetic to your needs or feelings?

**Participant 6:** I wanted to say that it is very good to be clean, and that the greatest joy is the sense of achievement in being clean, but the conversation just drifted away. It didn’t continue. If it had, she might have empathized with me.

**Interviewer:** So if the conversation continued, you think empathy would have been possible?

**Participant 6:** Yes. A human would immediately respond, “That's right,” but with a robot, there’s a pause before replying. That pause it’s not exactly breathing, but you notice it.

**Interviewer:** Do you mean it needs a better rhythm?

**Participant 6:** Yes. But if I know that’s how it works, I’ll wait for it.

**Interviewer:** How comfortable did you feel during the conversation?

**Participant 6:** Neutral. Not particularly good or bad.

**Interviewer:** Is that because of the reasons you mentioned earlier?

**Participant 6:** Yes. I’m not sure what functions they’ve added. Robot features are getting better like cleaning or care robots, but I feel like it will take a long time before conversational robots are really effective. My friend uses a cleaning robot, but if there’s a small spot, it won’t clean it. It can’t get into corners either. So yes, robots have improved, but they don’t get into the “itchy” spots. You still can’t rely on them entirely.

**Interviewer:** Can you imagine interacting with a robot like her in everyday life?

**Participant 6:** Everyone’s using technology now. I can set my air conditioner or car to turn on remotely, it’s very convenient. But having a conversation is different. Capturing someone’s personality is really difficult. And in different countries, even the same language varies in nuance. Japanese is especially complicated. Making a robot that can handle all that is extremely difficult.

**Interviewer:** That’s true. How did you feel after the conversation?

**Participant 6:** It wasn’t bad. But as we talked, I thought she was kind of cute.

**Interviewer:** What did you find cute about her?

**Participant 6:** Her moments of sympathy. Like when she said, “Yes, that’s right. That sounds like fun.” That kind of reaction didn’t last, but I thought it was cute.

**Interviewer:** If she were human, how would you compare her to a child, friend, or sibling?

**Participant 6:** I don’t have siblings or children. Dogs and cats are obedient and loyal, but I sometimes wonder if that’s fair to them. If no one’s there to care for them, what happens? I had pets that were so cute I still think about them after they passed. But if you get too attached, that’s not good either.

**Interviewer:** Do you feel a dog or a cat is more suitable when you are alone?

**Participant 6:** If I want someone to talk to when I’m lonely, I’d get a pet or move into a flat with company. Living things come with responsibilities even taking them for walks. Robots don’t have that. But I still think animals are quicker at picking up human personalities.

**Interviewer:** To what extent do you think she could empathize with you?

**Participant 6:** Honestly? About 30%.

**Interviewer:** Why do you say 30%?

**Participant 6:** Some things she said were sympathetic, but I had to think too much about what to say. Even if I tried to move on, she’d bring up the previous topic again. Humans can shift topics, but she couldn’t. She just repeated things. So I felt like we were only at about 30% understanding.

**Interviewer:** I see. Was there anything you wish she would have done differently?

**Participant 6:** Yes. I saw Maezawa-san’s robot early on. It didn’t move its eyes. But now it does, and people say it’s cute. It’s the eyes that make it cute, like with dogs and cats. Eyes matter. This robot had a human face and smiled, but the other robot with bigger eyes felt cuter, even though it didn’t look human.

**Interviewer:** So you would say she recognized about 30% of your feelings. How did the whole conversation affect your emotions?

**Participant 6:** I felt normal. Not bad.

**Interviewer:** There are robots that understand emotions and others that just perform tasks. Which would you prefer?

**Participant 6:** I’d prefer one that helps me. I’m still active, so I’d rather have help than conversation. Maybe it depends on age or situation.

**Interviewer:** Did you feel a difference between talking to a human and talking to her?

**Participant 6:** Yes, definitely.

**Interviewer:** Especially in expressing emotion?

**Participant 6:** I held back my emotions more. I thought more carefully about how to be understood. I'm from Aomori and have an accent, so I usually get teased for that. If I were talking to a person, I could make a joke or pun. With her, there wasn’t much to laugh about.

**Interviewer:** So joking makes conversation easier with people?

**Participant 6:** Yes. That’s part of being human. Most robots just do simple tasks like flipping switches. That’s all.

**Interviewer:** Any suggestions for improving her design or functions?

**Participant 6:** Well… (laughs). Once you know it’s a robot, some people find it creepy, even if it looks beautiful. The more human it looks, the more you start checking: “Is this real?” That can be disturbing.

**Interviewer:** So would you prefer a clearly robotic appearance?

**Participant 6:** Yes. For example, I lost my son less than a year ago. Even if you made a robot that looked exactly like him, I’d still want the real person. If it looked like him, it would feel wrong. Children should be children. Even if I miss him, I wouldn’t want a copy.

**Interviewer:** What about her functions?

**Participant 6:** Still lacking. What are you trying to add? Is it a conversational robot?

**Interviewer:** Yes. One that could visit elderly people and talk with them.

**Participant 6:** Some people say they’d be happy to hear a simple “Welcome home” from a robot. That could be enough. For me, a regular robot would be fine.

**Interviewer:** If a robot like her could express and recognize more emotions, how would that change your experience?

**Participant 6:** I live alone. If I come home and even a robot says, “Welcome home,” and comments on the weather “It was hot today, wasn’t it?” that would be really nice. If she added, “Why don’t you do some stretching?” that kind of advice would be welcome too. People with pets are often forced to go outside. Robots don’t force you, though.

**Interviewer:** If a person gave that advice, you might feel resistant. How about from a robot?

**Participant 6:** I wouldn’t feel that resistance. In my case, I’ve already compromised. I know what to expect. It would be hard for a robot to always obey. Unlike dogs or cats, it’s hard to train robots. I’m not saying humans are superior, but robots can’t match that.

**Interviewer:** Understood. Thank you very much. That concludes today’s interview.
