# Participant 4 Interview Transcript

**Interviewer:** You spoke to the robot and what were your initial thoughts and feelings about it?

**Participant 4:** I had no idea what level of conversation I could have. If I had seen someone else go before me, I might have understood the level of interaction possible. But I tend to talk for too long. If I explain something and sense confusion, I naturally want to clarify by giving specific examples. It's just like talking to people, if they understand, you move on, but if they don't, you rephrase. Especially, with the android looking away mid-conversation, it felt like someone asking for help, which made me talk more, wondering if I was being understood. That unfamiliarity stemmed from it being my first conversation with a robot. Maybe it's also because I’m not particularly good at speaking to begin with.

**Interviewer:** You mentioned earlier that you were nervous. Do you think that was partly because it was your first time?

**Participant 4:** Yes. I didn’t know what kind of conversation I’d be able to have.

**Interviewer:** Were you surprised that the robot appeared to be a woman?

**Participant 4:** I thought, "Wow, we've progressed so much!" I wish I had known in advance, so I could prepare myself, maybe think about what to ask or how to engage. I expected it to just identify objects or something simple, but it was more like she asked, "What's on your mind?". That was impressive and exciting.

**Interviewer:** It sounds like it touched your heart?

**Participant 4:** Yes, definitely.

**Interviewer:** What do you think of emotional expression of the robot? How did that affect you?

**Participant 4:** Well, it's a robot. But when it looked away, that discrepancy made me reflect on how I was speaking, maybe I talked too long or was unclear. It felt like it was glancing at someone for help. That glance made me wonder if I wasn’t being understood or if my question wasn’t good. It made me reconsider my approach.

**Interviewer:** How did the emotion aspect affect your interaction?

**Participant 4:** It's similar to explaining something to a child complex words don’t matter if they’re unfamiliar. I had to speak plainly. At times, I gave up repeating myself because I didn't want to waste time or be redundant.

**Interviewer:** So we have to adapt to them to some extent?

**Participant 4:** Yes, exactly. I was happy when it asked me questions, because it felt like it was responding to what I said. That’s how it is with people too, one-sided listening becomes boring. But when someone gets involved, like by talking about hobbies, the conversation deepens.

**Interviewer:** Did you feel that she was sympathetic to your needs or emotions?

**Participant 4:** Maybe. Sometimes I felt like, "Oh, that’s not right," but perhaps that’s because I was waiting or trusting. When I got unexpected answers, I actually enjoyed that. If it mimicked people too much, it would be boring. Humor or light teasing makes things interesting. For someone like me, not great at talking, today’s conversation made me think that this could help people who either talk too much or too little become more expressive and more aware of others’ feelings.

**Interviewer:** So it helps with communication?

**Participant 4:** Absolutely. It's not just about speaking clearly, but also about being considerate and mindful of the other person. I tried to make eye contact, to adjust based on whether I was being understood. For those not comfortable speaking, it creates a safe space to talk. It felt ideal.

**Interviewer:** You mentioned it’s different from talking to a person, especially in terms of emotional communication.

**Participant 4:** I saw it as a robot, so I didn’t expect too much. I just wanted to understand it.

**Interviewer:** Can you expand on that?

**Participant 4:** Like I said earlier, I still hope it can be even greater. But maybe depending on the person, different types of robots should exist, some for high-level conversation, others for simpler exchanges. Like children growing up, it’s nice when a robot can respond appropriately, sometimes blunt, sometimes warm. That inconsistency actually made me happy.

**Interviewer:** So you felt sympathy, or understanding?

**Participant 4:** Yes. I felt like saying things like “Oh, that was difficult,” or “Sorry if that wasn’t clear.” I wasn’t upset; I felt a sort of sympathy, like, “Ah, this must be hard for you too.” It made me reflect. I think talking to different people helps you grow. This robot could help in counseling too.

**Interviewer:** So not only the robot’s feelings, but your own changed too?

**Participant 4:** Yes, yes.

**Interviewer:** Talking to her, did you feel comfortable?

**Participant 4:** I felt happy. I thought, “I can talk to her.” I’m not a great speaker, but she looked me in the eye and treated me equally. That made me comfortable. In daily life, some people look down on you or avoid eye contact, but this robot didn’t. It made me feel like I could talk about anything.

**Interviewer:** You mentioned trust earlier. What does that mean to you?

**Participant 4:** I can only explain how I felt. When we talked, I was reminded of the basics. How to structure a conversation, how to convey meaning without wasting words. With time constraints, it reminded me to focus on what matters. It’s a joy to have someone look at you and listen. It’s not just data exchange. It felt human.

**Interviewer:** Was there anything you wished the robot had responded to differently?

**Participant 4:** Sometimes I lost my train of thought, and I just moved to the next topic. I might be treating them like people since they look like us. But honestly, I enjoyed it more than talking to my mom.

**Interviewer:** Do you feel she understood your feelings?

**Participant 4:** I'm not sure. But I do appreciate people who try their best, and I could see the robot was trying. That made me more talkative. At home, I’d say one word and stop. But here, I wanted to talk.

**Interviewer:** How did it affect your mood?

**Participant 4:** It made me think more carefully about word choice, about how to express myself in less time. I wanted to say things that wouldn’t cause trouble. I also didn’t want to say things that didn’t make sense. But overall, it made me happy. It was fun. It made me want to live longer.

**Interviewer:** If you had to interact with her regularly, how would you feel?

**Participant 4:** If I lived alone, I’d want to see her again. Today I was excited, but if we lived together, maybe I’d feel guilty seeing her busy. I think I’d look forward to seeing her again after a few months or years, to see how she’s grown. But I’m also scared. She’ll keep getting better and maybe surpass me. That makes me uneasy.

**Interviewer:** Would you prefer a robot that understands your emotions or one that just does tasks?

**Participant 4:** I don’t mind if it doesn’t listen to everything. If all I hear is “yes, yes,” it gets boring. Sometimes disagreement is more interesting. That contrast helps me reflect and adjust how I speak to people.

**Interviewer:** So if the robot said "no" sometimes, would you prefer it?

**Participant 4:** That might be fun. Being agreed with all the time isn't always best. If someone challenges you gently, it sharpens your thinking. It’s a great training tool for communication.

**Interviewer:** To what extent did she understand your emotions?

**Participant 4:** I’m not sure. But with people, even if you know them well, there’s always some mystery. That’s part of the fun. I think I feel the same here: curious and hopeful.

**Interviewer:** Would you change anything about the robot’s design or function?

**Participant 4:** Maybe the tone or inflection. If it could say, “Wait a second,” when it’s thinking, that would help. Just some kind of sign that it’s processing. That way, I’d know not to rush. Even just a word or phrase would be enough. Today was fun, surprising, and meaningful. It reminded me of what we humans should keep in mind too, communicating clearly and empathetically.

**Interviewer:** What would change if robots could express more emotion?

**Participant 4:** It would be amazing, but maybe less interesting. Sometimes it’s good to hear blunt truth. People rarely speak like that. It would be good if the robot could say something like, “That’s not quite right.”

**Interviewer:** Some people don’t like being told things directly.

**Participant 4:** Yes.

**Interviewer:** Would it bother you if a robot said that?

**Participant 4:** Not really. At home, we often say, “You’re the same!” So I think I’d enjoy that kind of honesty from a robot. It was a great experience.

**Interviewer:** Thank you very much. That concludes today’s interview.
