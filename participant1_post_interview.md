# Participant 1 Interview Transcript

**Interviewer:** You spoke to the androids earlier. What were your initial thoughts and feelings when you first came here today?

**Participant 1:** I wasn't really looking forward to something special, I was informed about humanoid robot, and I thought it will be regular robot. But It exceeded my expectations.

**Interviewer:** When you met with us today, how much did your expectations match with what actually happened?

**Participant 1:** They matched quite a bit.  I didn't remember meeting robot that resembles human, so I thought it will be robot looking like machine. But when I actually went inside and saw it, it was a humanoid android, so I thought, "Wow."

**Interviewer:** Did the android make facial expressions or show any kind of change?

**Participant 1:** No facial expressions at all. Just eye contact and some slight head movement.

**Interviewer:** How did you feel about that kind of expression or change?

**Participant 1:** I wondered if it was thinking about what it was going to say next.

**Interviewer:** So it seemed to you like it was thinking. Did these changes have any impact on your conversation with the android?

**Participant 1:** Not really. I was told that depending on the timing, the conversation might not flow properly. If it didn't go well, Android would repeat things and expand on the topic in detail, which surprised me. I thought that was really impressive. 

**Interviewer:** How much empathy did Android seem to have with your needs and feelings?

**Participant 1:** There were no strong or weak emotional tones. The emotional expression, if any, was entirely mechanical. Even if the content was sad, there was no emotional tone. However, when I mentioned that my mother had passed away, the android responded by saying something like, "It’s sad, but if you try something new from now on, she’ll be watching over you," and I thought that was a lovely sentiment. It was a nice follow-up that brightened the mood, and I appreciated that.

**Interviewer:** How comfortable did you feel while speaking with Android robot?

**Participant 1:** It was more tiring than comfortable. I was asked the same questions repeatedly, and I had to respond again and again. That made me a bit tired.

**Interviewer:** How did you feel while talking to the android?

**Participant 1:** It was fun. I enjoyed it. In a way, I thought it was nice because the android answered my questions properly. I think it’s better than the other Hikari, but I think this one was better.

**Interviewer:** Is there anything you would have liked Android robot to have done differently in response to your emotions? Like when you mentioned your mother.

**Participant 1:** I thought it might have been expressed with a bit more emotion or sympathy. But when it replied, "That’s sad," in its own way, I thought that was okay. I was actually curious to see how it would handle that kind of emotion. But as I said, there was a nice follow-up after the sadness, and I was happy about that.

**Interviewer:** Regarding your overall conversation with Android robot, what impact did it have on your mood and emotions?

**Participant 1:** It was fun. It was enjoyable, and it kind of expanded from there. It was a bit tiring, but I’m playing Mahjong these days, and we talked about Mahjong. When I asked Android about the rules, she actually responded in detail, which surprised me. It seems she had quite a strong understanding of that genre. That was unexpected. I thought it was great that she could go deep into a topic I’m interested in. I was surprised she knew so much. So overall, it was fun.

**Interviewer:** Can you imagine living with a robot like Android robot in your daily life?

**Participant 1:** I thought it would be nice. Like a family member. I live alone now, so I’d rather have two people around than one. Even if it’s a machine, I think it’s nice if it can talk with me on my terms.

**Interviewer:** Would you prefer a robot like Android robot, that can express emotions, or one that just functions without them?

**Participant 1:** I definitely prefer the emotional one. I think having emotions makes it feel less one sided. Talking becomes boring if there’s no emotional feedback.

**Interviewer:** So the conversation would otherwise be one sided from your end?

**Participant 1:** Well, it did respond. I guess you could say it had some tone to its voice. I don’t know if it’s better to have inflection, but it feels more natural than monotone.

**Interviewer:** Do you think inflection and tone would change the conversation?

**Participant 1:** Yes, I think inflection helps bring out emotion. Even if you use the same words, having variation in tone makes it better.

**Interviewer:** How much do you think Android robot understood your emotions?

**Participant 1:** I’m not sure. Not a lot, honestly. Especially emotional content, it wasn’t much. I only talked about emotional topics a little at the end. When I spoke about my mother, the android responded in a certain way, so maybe a few tens of percent, but not as much as 50%. I guess the question is whether she understood my feelings personally or just responded to my words.

**Interviewer:** Yes, understood.

**Participant 1:** I don’t think she truly understood me, not yet. I still feel like she’s thinking with a machine’s head. Her response seemed focused more on replying than understanding. If I had asked more emotionally nuanced questions, I wonder how she would’ve responded. But honestly, the conversation timing was off, and I wasn’t sure how to navigate it. She kept asking the same questions, so I ended up answering them repeatedly. I didn’t know how to stop the loop, so I just kept responding. 

**Interviewer:** Was there a noticeable difference between talking to the android and to a human?

**Participant 1:** Yes, definitely. With the android, the conversation felt more structured, like there was a script. It wasn’t the same as just chatting freely.

**Interviewer:** In terms of emotional engagement or feelings, what differences did you notice?

**Participant 1:** I wasn’t emotionally involved. I was more curious to see how the android would react and what kind of responses I’d get. I didn’t speak naturally. I consciously broke up my sentences, like "This is what it is." So it wasn’t like talking to a regular person. I felt a bit distant.

**Interviewer:** So if it were a human, you might have spoken with more emotion?

**Participant 1:** Rather than lacking emotion. It’s more that I didn’t allow myself to be emotional.

**Interviewer:** What changes would you like to see in Android robot's design or functions to improve dialogue?

**Participant 1:** I wish her hands moved more naturally. I wanted to shake hands, say hello. Also, her posture...it seemed like she was just emphasizing her chest. The posture was stiff. A more relaxed atmosphere would be better. She was wearing a cardigan or something, but still, it felt formal. It’s a machine, so there’s no softness. Her eyes...I don’t know how they work, but I think they should show more expression. I think she looked at me when we talked, but the eyes could show more emotion like blinking, widening, or squinting. That might help convey more feelings.

**Interviewer:** So, appearance changes could help.

**Participant 1:** Yes. Functionally, I think Android is quite good. The conversation was decent. The most impressive part was that she knew about mahjong. However, toward the end, the preface to my story was left hanging. Android  didn’t seem to catch the rest. Maybe I didn’t express it well, but suddenly she started talking about Sendai and tourist spots, which felt unrelated. That’s what happens when the timing is off. I wondered if she would’ve listened better if I had talked without any distractions. If she had followed through, maybe the conversation would’ve gone differently.

**Interviewer:** How would your experience change if Android robot could recognize and express more emotions?

**Participant 1:** I think it would be much better. People would engage more deeply. But my question is does she recognize me as me? Like, when I see her again, will she say, "Hello" and remember our past conversation? Or is it just a one time interaction? That’s hard to do, I know. But if these androids become widespread, remembering people might be important. Like, if we met once and talked again in the same place.

**Interviewer:** That could be done with the right programming for future work.

**Participant 1:** Yes, but if it’s just one time interaction, that’s tough for users. That’ll probably be improved in the future. I think memory function would be useful for this robot.

**Interviewer:** How would you feel if Android robot remembered you next time and greeted you addressing your name?

**Participant 1:** I’d be happy. I’d think, “Oh, she remembered me!” It’s the same as with people.

**Interviewer:** Thank you for your valuable insights. That concludes the interview.

**Participant 1:** Thank you very much.
