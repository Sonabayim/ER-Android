# Participant 8 Interview Transcript

**Interviewer:** You spoke to the android earlier. What were your initial thoughts and feelings as you first spoke to them?

**Participant 8:** Initially, it was a surprise. I had the impression that there were people there, rather than it being virtual. I didn't feel any discomfort.

**Interviewer:** Why is that?

**Participant 8:** It also showed facial expressions. But there was a bit of a pause before I got an answer, so I felt it was virtual in that area. However, when I first met it, I was rather surprised. It felt as if there really was a flesh and blood person there.

**Interviewer:** Like a surprise?

**Participant 8:** Yes. I was surprised and impressed that it had evolved so far.

**Interviewer:** Before coming here, what expectations did you have about interacting with the android?

**Participant 8:** I had no idea what it meant. I couldn't assume what it would be like. It came to me like, "please do whatever you want."

**Interviewer:** Did you come here with high expectations?

**Participant 8:** Not at all. I had no specific expectations. I didn't know the content at all, just that it was an experimental study.

**Interviewer:** You mentioned earlier that the android had expressions. How did you feel about that?

**Participant 8:** When I think of android robot, I have a strong image of them as cold or object like. But this one had moving eyes, nodding its head as if understanding what I was saying. Even without verbal communication, the movement felt human.

**Interviewer:** How did the android's expressions affect your interaction?

**Participant 8:** It felt as if we were really looking at each other, or rather, it was looking at me. It felt like genuine conversation. However, staying near the microphone was a bit distracting. Without this, I could have spoken without any discomfort. It was a good experience and enjoyable. It was detailed. Initially, I repeated myself because I didn't fully understand how to interact. But in the second half, it responded very well to my adjusted approach. I wanted to do more interaction.

**Interviewer:** Did it feel too short?

**Participant 8:** Just as I was barely getting used to it, yes. But it was enjoyable.

**Interviewer:** Did you feel the android's facial expressions were sympathetic to your emotions?

**Participant 8:** Yes, from the start I was like, "What? Are they already switched on?" It felt genuine.

**Interviewer:** What specifically made you feel that way?

**Participant 8:** Its eye movements, and when it didn't understand, it tilted its head slightly. If a question was clear, responses came smoothly without distortion or hesitation.

**Interviewer:** Regarding emotional communication, how did the android respond?

**Participant 8:** Towards the end, quite noticeably. It seemed to try very hard to understand and explain, making me feel it genuinely cared, even if it's artificial.

**Interviewer:** You discussed many positive topics. How comfortable did you feel?

**Participant 8:** Very comfortable. We talked about things I love, gardening and traveling, especially Finland and the UK. It responded clearly and precisely, even providing additional historical context about the UK, which was enjoyable. I would have loved more in depth conversation.

**Interviewer:** Did you want to discuss anything in particular more deeply?

**Participant 8:** Yes, particularly Finland, as it wasn't a sightseeing trip but experiencing normal life with Finnish acquaintances. There was much more I wanted to ask. If I ranked this experience, it would be at the top. It's rare to find someone who can discuss less common locations in detail. The android could seemingly answer anything.

**Interviewer:** Did you experience pleasant emotions?

**Participant 8:** Definitely. It felt completely different from other devices I currently use. If this were available for older users, they would certainly feel happy.

**Interviewer:** Was there anything you wish the android had responded differently to?

**Participant 8:** Maybe the way it talked, particularly during longer responses. It felt somewhat like reading from a book. A more conversational tone and emotional intonation would significantly enhance interaction.

**Interviewer:** Would improved facial expressions and voice intonations help the android better understand your emotions?

**Participant 8:** Absolutely. It would deepen our interaction and create a feeling of genuine friendship.

**Interviewer:** What impact did the interaction have on your overall mood and emotions?

**Participant 8:** From the very start, I felt happy, not nervous. The emotional closeness increased as we conversed.

**Interviewer:** Can you imagine interacting with an android like this regularly in your daily life?

**Participant 8:** Right now, I am healthy and travel frequently, but as I get older and less mobile, having someone to reminisce with would be wonderful. It would help activate forgotten memories. I wanted to discuss many more topics, although the session was limited. When I couldn’t answer questions well, it still engaged positively, echoing my thoughts. This helped sustain the conversation.

**Interviewer:** Would you prefer a robot capable of emotional interaction or one only for practical tasks?

**Participant 8:** Emotional interaction, definitely. Mental well-being is very important, especially in old age. If a robot could provide emotional support, I'd feel more motivated to remain active and engaged.

**Interviewer:** How accurately did you feel the android recognized your emotions?

**Participant 8:** Initially, the questions seemed slightly off, but towards the end, it recognized emotions well. Given more time, deeper emotional interactions would be possible.

**Interviewer:** Did you find emotional communication different from talking to a human?

**Participant 8:** With humans, conversations naturally expand into related topics spontaneously. Android conversations remain more limited, directly answering questions without branching out spontaneously.

**Interviewer:** What improvements would you suggest for the android’s design or functionality?

**Participant 8:** Visually, it felt slightly cold. Softer materials resembling skin or cloth would make it more realistic. Regarding functionality, extending uninterrupted conversation time would significantly improve interactions.

**Interviewer:** How would emotional expressions from the android change your experience?

**Participant 8:** It would significantly enhance the interaction, making conversations deeper and less superficial, allowing for greater empathy and attentiveness.

**Interviewer:** Thank you very much for your detailed feedback.

**Participant 8:** You're welcome. It was a wonderful experience, and I'm always open to participating again in the future.
